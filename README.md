# Work Day Scheduler Challenge by Mark Kanczuzewski

The purpose of this exersize was to create an planning application that displays the hours for an average workday. Each hour has the ability to save task descriptions to local storage and then load them on page load as needed. The hours are color coded based on the current time to show past, present, and future. The current day and date are displayed at the top of the page and every 30 minutes the page content refreshes, which will then move the color codes as appropriate.
